# Stock-price-forecasting-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This major project aims to develop and evaluate a novel CNN-LSTM-based model for forecasting stock prices. The proposed model leverages the strengths of both CNNs and LSTMs to effectively capture the underlying patterns and trends present in historical stock price data.
